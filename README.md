Privacy Policy â€“ WCTrivia
WCTrivia is a free trivia game developed and published by FairplayTriviaSports. This mobile application is provided as-is and does not collect or store personal information from users. This policy explains how we handle technical attribution data related to Meta (Facebook and Instagram) advertising campaigns.

How We Use Meta Services
Our app participates in app install campaigns run through Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram). When a user clicks on an ad and installs the app from Google Play, we may receive anonymous attribution data from Meta via the Google Play Install Referrer API. This helps us understand which advertising campaigns are effective.

We do not collect:

Personal information

Facebook profile data

Login credentials

We do not use Facebook Login or request any permissions from user accounts.

Information Collected
The app itself does not collect any personal data.

We may receive technical, non-identifiable information such as:

Click timestamps

Campaign IDs

Referrer strings

This data is used only to measure ad performance and optimize our user acquisition strategy.

Childrenâ€™s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 18. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately and we will delete the data.

Third-Party Access
We do not share any data with third parties. The only external service involved is Meta, which provides anonymous campaign tracking data through industry-standard attribution mechanisms.

Policy Updates
This policy may be updated from time to time. We recommend reviewing this page periodically for any changes.
Effective Date: July 8, 2025
