  <h1>Privacy Policy – WCTrivia</h1>

  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 8, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>WCTrivia</strong> is a free trivia game developed and published by <strong>FairplayTriviaSports</strong>. This mobile application is provided as-is and does not collect or store personal information from users. This policy explains how we handle technical attribution data related to Meta (Facebook and Instagram) advertising campaigns.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Meta Services</h2>
  <p>Our app participates in app install campaigns run through <strong>Meta platforms (Facebook and Instagram)</strong>. When a user clicks on an ad and installs the app from <strong>Google Play</strong>, we may receive <strong>anonymous attribution data</strong> from Meta via the <em>Google Play Install Referrer API</em>. This helps us understand which advertising campaigns are effective.</p>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Personal information</li>
    <li>Facebook profile data</li>
    <li>Login credentials</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use <strong>Facebook Login</strong> or request any permissions from user accounts.</p>

  <h2>Information Collected</h2>
  <p>The app itself does <strong>not collect any personal data</strong>.</p>
  <p>We may receive technical, non-identifiable information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Click timestamps</li>
    <li>Campaign IDs</li>
    <li>Referrer strings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used only to measure ad performance and optimize our user acquisition strategy.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 18. If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately and we will delete the data.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
  <p>We do not share any data with third parties. The only external service involved is <strong>Meta</strong>, which provides anonymous campaign tracking data through industry-standard attribution mechanisms.</p>

  <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>This policy may be updated from time to time. We recommend reviewing this page periodically for any changes.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
